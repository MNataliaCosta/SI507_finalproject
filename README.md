## Project Description
This project aggregates music events data from Ticketmaster and song data from iTunes. It allows users to:
1. search events by city;
2. search events by genre;
3. search events by artist and see a list of 10 recommended songs for the selected artist

## How to run
1. Using your command line interface (e.g. GitBash), access the directory where the project files are saved  
2. Install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python SI507project_tools.py runserver`

## How to use
1. Open your browser and access http://localhost:5000
2. Interact with the application using the different routes available (see *Routes in this application* for more details )

## Routes in this application
* `/` - home page; provide an overview of what the application does and how it works, including the links to navigate to the possible routes
* `/events-per-location` - using the dropdown form, the user can select which city currently available in the database to search for events and submit the search
* `/events-per-location/result` - displays a list of events based on the search by city
* `/events-per-genre` - using the dropdown form, the user can select which genre currently available in the database to search for events and submit the search
* `/events-per-genre/result` - displays a list of events based on the search by genre
* `/events-per-artist` - using the dropdown form, the user can select which artist currently available in the database to search for events and submit the search
* `/events-per-artist/result` - displays a list of events based on the search by artist as well as list of 10 recommended songs of the artist

Under `screenshots/` you can find screenshots of how the program should look like when working properly.

## How to run tests
1. Make sure you have SQLite3 installed
2. Using your command line interface (e.g. GitBash), access the directory where the project files are saves
3. Run `python SI507project_tests.py`
4. There are currently 9 tests in the test suite; all of them should pass for the code to be properly working
